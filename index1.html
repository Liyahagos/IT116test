        <h1>The Forgotten Genocide</h1>

        <h2>Tigray Genocide</h2>

        <p>On November 4th, 2020, unelected Prime Minister 
            of Ethiopia Abiy Ahmed declared a genocidal war on Tigray, the northernmost 
            regional state of Ethiopia, in collaboration with President of Eritrea 
            Isaias Afwerki. Since then, his administration has limited and/or blocked
            access to electricity, aid, food, and water for millions of Tigrayan civilians.
            Under leadership of Abiy and Isaias, Ethiopian troops, Eritrean troops and Amhara
            Militias have committed significant war crimes and ethnic cleansing, from massacring
            civilians, weaponizing starvation and weaponizing sexual and gender based violence 
            against women and girls. In response to the genocidal war, Omna Tigray was created 
            with a focus on educated advocacy and economic development for Tigrayans. Join our 
            global movement, and help us call for an end to the Tigray Genocide </p>
