 <h1>Tigray Region</h1>   
    <p>The Tigray Region (/tɪˈɡraɪ/; Tigrinya: ክልል ትግራይ; Amharic:
      ትግራይ ክልል, romanized: Tigrāy kilil), 
      officially the Tigray National Regional State 
      (Tigrinya: ብሔራዊ ክልላዊ መንግስቲ ትግራይ,romanized: 
      Bəh̩erawi Kəllelawi Mängəśti Təgray), is the 
      northernmost regional state in Ethiopia.
      The Tigray Region is the homeland of the Tigrayan,
      Irob and Kunama people. Formerly known as Region 1, 
      its capital and largest city is Mekelle. Tigray is 
      the fifth-largest by area, the fifth-most populous,
      and the fifth-most densely populated of the 11 regional states.</p>

<h2>Tigray Region</h2>
   <p>In November 2020 the Ethiopian government began military operations 
      in the Tigray region against the region’s ruling party, 
      the Tigray People’s Liberation Front. Civilian structures in towns
      in Tigray, including hospitals, schools, factories, 
      and businesses, were shelled, looted and destroyed by Ethiopian 
      federal forces and regional militias, and by Eritrean armed forces.
      The fighting and continued restrictions on humanitarian access forced 
      more than two million people to flee their homes, with thousands
      fleeing into Sudan, and left at least 2.3 million in need of assistance.</p>

<h3>Tigray Region</h3>
   <p>We note with the utmost alarm that thousands of Ethiopians of Tigrayan 
      ethnicity reportedly continue to be detained arbitrarily in
      life-threatening conditions in western Tigray.  We urge the 
      immediate release of any such remaining detainees and call on relevant 
      authorities to grant international monitors access to all 
      detention facilities. It remains our firm position that there must be 
      credible investigations into and accountability for atrocities 
      committed by any party to the conflict as part of any lasting 
      solution to the crisis.  We urge the Government of Ethiopia to 
      cooperate with the UN Commission of Experts on Human Rights in Ethiopia.</p>

<h4>Tigray Region</h4>
   <P>Continued reports of atrocities underscore the urgency of ending the 
      military conflict.  We strongly support the declarations of a 
      cessation of hostilities by the Government of Ethiopia and the 
      Tigray regional authority and welcome the news that they have been 
      followed by initial convoys of life-saving assistance.  
      In keeping with these declarations, we renew our call 
      on all armed actors to renounce and end human rights abuses 
      and violence against civilians.  The United States reiterates 
      its call for all foreign forces to withdraw from Ethiopia as 
      well as for the regional state authorities to remove their 
      security forces from neighboring regions.We continue to urge
      all parties to take necessary steps to ensure the cessation 
      of hostilities, unhindered and sustained humanitarian access, 
      transparent investigations into human rights abuses and violations 
      by all actors, and a negotiated resolution to the conflict in Ethiopia.</P>
