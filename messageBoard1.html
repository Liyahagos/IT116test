    <p> Ger‘alta is a principally mountainous zone located in a sandstone escarpment in south-central Tigray. 
        It is in the district of Hawzen, which is presumed to date back to the South-Arabian migration to 
        Ethiopia in 8th to 7th BCE. Pottery, inscriptions and hagiographic traditions dating back to the Aksumite 
        period depict Ger‘alta as one of the most important regions of ancient civilisation in the Horn of Africa. 
        Cartographically, it appears in the 15th century as a component of the Ǝndärta province that occupied 
        eastern and south eastern Tigray. Ger'alta’s mountains give it one of the most captivating terrains in 
        the northern Ethiopian highlands. Many of these mountains host ancient rock-hewn churches and monasteries, 
        making the area a spiritual haven for pilgrims. These structures are recognised as world heritage sites. 
        Despite having low levels of tourism development, the area was among Tigray’s most popular travel destinations.
